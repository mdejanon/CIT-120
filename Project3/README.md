Project 3:

Design a number guessing game program. The program should generate a random number and then ask the user to guess the number. Each time the user enters his or her guess, the program should indicate whether it was too high or too low. The game is over when the user correctly guesses the number. When the game ends, the program should display the number of guesses that the user made.
