CIT 12000: Quantitative Analysis

Course Overview: 

Throughout this course you will break down programming problems using planning tools, flowcharting, and pseudocode. Then you will transform your design into a working solution using Python programming language. The key in this class is repetition and practice.

Project 1:

A customer in a store is purchasing four items. Design a program that asks for the price of each item, calculates the sales tax amount of the subtotal with a rate of 6%, and then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total.

Project 2:

The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:

Weight of Package	- Rate per Pound
2 pounds or less -	$1.10
Over 2 pounds but not more than 6 pounds -	$2.20
Over 6 pounds but not more than 10 pounds -	$3.70
Over 10 pounds - $3.80

Design a program that asks the user to enter the weight of a package and then displays the shipping charges.


Project 3:

Design a number guessing game program. The program should generate a random number and then ask the user to guess the number. Each time the user enters his or her guess, the program should indicate whether it was too high or too low. The game is over when the user correctly guesses the number. When the game ends, the program should display the number of guesses that the user made.

Project 4:

A painting company has determined that for every 115 square feet of wall space, one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required.  The company charged $20.00 per hour for labor.  Design a modular program that asks the user to enter the square feet of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon.  The program should display the following data:

•	The number of gallons of paint required

•	The hours of labor required

•	The cost of the paint

•	The labor charges

•	The total cost of the paint job

Project 5:

This program will compute the summation of the square of two numbers by following the requirement below:
1.	main module(): the main module will generate two numbers randomly and pass those two numbers to the calculateSum function. Once calculateSum function returns the summation, the main module will display the summation output.
2.	calculateSum() function: calculateSum function will receive two numbers from the main module. Then it will make a square of the numbers by using a built-in function. Then it will compute the sum and return the summation to the main module.

The program should display the following data:

•	the random numbers

•	square of both numbers

•	summation output

Project 6:

Design a payroll program that prompts the user to enter an employee’s hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Validate the user’s input so that only pay rates in the range of $7.50 through $18.25 and hours in the range of 0 through 40 are accepted. The program should display the employee’s gross pay.

Project 7:

Design a program that asks the user to enter a store’s sales for each day of the week. The amounts should be stored in an array. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for the week and display the result.
